# Piriform Test

A coding test to work across browsers from IE7 upwards incl. other popular browsers.

## Considerations

- Using the simplest HTML possible to achieve layouts.
- Removed whitespace between inline-block elements.
- I have sourced and replaced images where appropriate or left placeholders for them to be inserted.
- Using JS Libraries known to work with lower versions of Internet Explorer.
- To save time I have simply hidden the other slides in IE7, graceful.
- Used best practices to apply css to less able browsers.
- I also cooked tea and went out to buy some cake during the process!
