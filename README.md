# Piriform Test

A coding test to work across browsers from IE7 upwards incl. other popular browsers.

## Considerations

- Using the simplest HTML possible to achieve layouts.
- Removed whitespace between inline-block elements.
- I have sourced and replaced images where appropriate or left placeholders for them to be inserted.
- Using JS Libraries known to work with lower versions of Internet Explorer.
